The project (code) for [reactive autocomplete with polymer and rxjs](http://www.bbartosz.com/blog/2015/08/29/reactive-autocomplete-with-polymer-and-rxjs/)

## Branches

- `master` + `initial setup`
- `final-version`

Note: Branches have unrelated git histories

## Run

Best advice is to create a new Polymer project from scratch, then port the code from here. It is not currently setup to run out of the box. No web server.
